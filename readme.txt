This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words sung most famously by Louis Armstrong.

== Description ==

This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the NOT hope and NOT enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in one word: <strong>Global Pandemic</strong>. 
When activated you will randomly see a quote from <cite>Rick and Morty</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

Based on Hello Dolly by Matt.
